#### Control Flow
Order in which a program executes code.

print("Hello, welcome to programming.")

a = 10
b = 5
result = a + b

print(f"The result of adding {a} and {b} is {result}")

print("Thank you")


#### Sequential Control Flow
Execution of code statements one after another, in the order they appear in the program.

#### Conditional control flow / Control Flow
Execution of code statements based on some input.

If ("if" is a condition) 

If tomorrow is Saturday
    set the alarm for 7
If tomorrow is Tuesday
    set alarm for 6

#### Boolean Data Types

There are two values - TRUE and FALSE
Works similarly to binary in that there are two options - TRUE or FALSE
Boolean values are used to control the flow of the program.
